# postfix

A Clojure library designed to evaluate postfix expressions. 

An example of a postfix expression is `1 2 3 + 4 5 * * +`  
The infix notation version of this expression is `( 1 + ( ( 2 + 3 ) * ( 4 * 5 ) ) ) `

## Usage

To use the regexp-based evaluator, start a `repl` and run:
```
(evaluator-regexp "expression as a string")
```
